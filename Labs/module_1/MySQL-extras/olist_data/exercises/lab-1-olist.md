# Lab | SQL

## Introduction

Run your first SQL commands! In this lab, we will practice selecting and projecting data. You can finish all questions with only those clauses:
- `SELECT`
- `SELECT DISTINCT`
- `FROM`
- `WHERE`
- `ORDER BY`
- `GROUP BY`
- `LIMIT`

and aggregate functions:
- `COUNT`
- `SUM`
- `MIN`
- `MAX`

Please submit your solutions in a text file `solutions.sql`.
